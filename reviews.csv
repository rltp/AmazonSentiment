0,Manoj,5.0,Good Sound. not recommended for android gamers,  Soubd quality is awesome. Bass mids and highs vocals are clearly audible with good quality. But if you are android user please note that there is a slight delay in audio while gaming ( approximately 150ms-200ms). for iphone users no delay in audio. Battery Backup is awesome (major pro).
1,Tejas Kaundal,5.0,Totally Worth It!!,"  If you are the fence about buying this product, do not think twice. It sounds great, looks great, comfortable for long periods of wear and has amazing battery life. Would just suggest that you buy a 5w apple charger to charge it, so as to protect the battery against degradation."
2,Shopaholic,4.0,Earphones are good. Charging case isn't as good,"  Earphones are very good. Great range, great quality. Not giving it five stars only because the charging mechanism is not smooth. I need to try multiple times to place the earphones correctly to charge them.Overall good earphones. Would recommend"
3,Kunal Bhardwaj,1.0,Really bad for exercise.,"  It does not stay firm around the ears. While any vigorous movement like running, skipping etc the earbuds come loose. The worst is that all the sweat trickles under the earbuds and makes it further loose and you need to keep taking them off and wiping the buds and your ears dry. The worst set of running earbuds I have ever bud. Should stick to the Bose ones only."
4,Vineet Singhania,5.0,Great  product from beats.,  Good quality & good sound.
5,Customer ,5.0,Amazing product,  Amazing productThe fit and finish is really up to notchI expected them to be a little base heavy but they are decent
6,Arun Rajsekaran,4.0,Good but not worth it,"  It's good but not worth the price, if it's for heavy sports go for it but the sound quality is not up to the mark. Battery life is great and looks good, fits good but one has to find the right fit spot for prolonged use."
7,Arun,2.0,Warranty issues are there,  Sir I have purchased this product from appario retail on jan 25 2020 ... now it’s not working ..: so I have went to the store room and gave but they told that the warranty has finished .... what should I do now ??????
8,Gautam Bajaj,5.0,Great set of earbuds,  Happy with purchase
9,Rajesh Bariyar,5.0,Powerbeats pro.,  Sound quality is awesome.It is good for running and for gym.If you need product like this definitely go for it.Noise cancellationIs also good but it’s passive.
10,Amazomer,5.0,Best beats ever,  Best thing i ve ever bought on Amazon...
11,Gaurav Bagga,5.0,Great product,  Bought it for my friend and he loves it
12,Rajiv Gupta,3.0,Overhyped.. inferior quality,  It hangs several times which is very annoying

14,Aman,5.0,Pro,  Worth call name pro
15,Amazon Customer,5.0,Pbp,  Good sound
16,Daniel,4.0,Good,  Overpriced
17,VIVEK SHIVDASANI,5.0,Worth the high price and better then the apple earpods.,  These do not sound so good if you pair them with older models of laptops. I have a 2015 MacBook Pro and the Powerbeats Pro sounds very tinny and the audio quality is reminiscent of cheaper earphones. I was really disappointed and felt that I had wasted Rs 21500/-. However on using them with the iPad Pro 11 Inch and the iPhone 11 Pro they sound fantastic. I am thrilled with these Powerbeats Pro Earphones. The important thing is that these later two devices have bluetooth 5.0 whereas the 2015 MacBook Pro does not and that makes all the difference to the sound quality. The battery life is also another plus point. You can use these earphones for hours and hours at a time without worrying about the battery dying out. The build quality is sturdy and they look good.
18,Jamshed,5.0,Amazing,  I love this .. that’s far better than Bose sound free... I switched from Bose to beats n I love this .
19,Harish,1.0,Awesome headphone with poor Amazon delivery service,  Headphones are really good. No lag and secure fit. Sound is awesome. One star for Amazon delivery since it never arrived and had to cancel the order and placed from other site
